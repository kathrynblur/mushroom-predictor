# mushroom-predictor
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible. The prediction is based on the Mushroom-Classification dataset from Kaggle.  
# Project Overview  
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify mushrooms as either poisonous or edible. This is achieved by analyzing various features of mushrooms provided in the dataset, such as cap shape, cap diameter, stem color etc. Subsequently, multiple Machine Learning models are trained to identify the best-performing one.
# Dataset
The Mushroom Classification dataset from Kaggle includes 54035 instances of mushrooms with 9 different features. Each feature represents a characteristic of the mushroom, and the target variable indicates whether the mushroom is edible or poisonous.
# Key Features
1) Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Initial data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships of the features, followed by data cleaning and preprocessing.  
2) Feature Engineering: Transforming and selecting the most relevant features for the predictive model.  
3) Model Building and Evaluation: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms to find the best-performing model. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the model's performance.  
4) Visualization: Visual representation of the data and the model's performance using plots and charts.  
# Usage
To use this repository, clone the repository and run the notebook making sure the datasets used are in the same folder as the notebook.
